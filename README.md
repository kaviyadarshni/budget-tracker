My JavaFX Budget Tracker
For my project, I developed a Personal Finance Manager application using Java. This project allowed me to practically apply several important Java skills that I have learned. I used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation, and methods to structure the program clearly. I created separate classes such as Transaction and FinanceManager to keep the logic organized. The Transaction class stores details like date, description, type, category, and amount, whereas the FinanceManager class handles the logic for adding, viewing, and summarizing transactions.

I also applied my knowledge of file handling in Java to save and load user data. By using classes like FileWriter, BufferedReader, and PrintWriter, I ensured that all transactions entered by the user are stored permanently in a text file. This allowed the program to maintain data even after closing and reopening, which made the application more practical and realistic.

Additionally, I used exception handling to make the system error-free. For example, when users enter invalid numbers or types, the program catches exceptions such as NumberFormatException and asks the user to try again. This increased the reliability and user-friendliness of the application.

Another Java skill I applied was working with the Scanner class for user input. I designed a simple menu-driven interface, allowing users to select options such as adding a transaction, viewing past entries, and checking financial summaries.

Finally, I applied logical thinking and conditional statements to calculate total income, total expenses, and balance dynamically based on user data.

Overall, this project helped me combine different Java skills—OOP, file handling, exception management, and user interaction—to build a functional, real-world console application.
